    Note : makemigrations basically generates the SQL commands for preinstalled apps (which can be viewed in installed apps in settings.py) and your newly created apps' model which you add in installed apps.It does not execute those commands in your database file. So tables doesn't created after makemigrations.
    After applying makemigrations you can see those SQL commands with sqlmigrate which shows all the SQL commands which has been generated by makemigrations.
    migrate executes those SQL commands in database file.So after executing migrate all the tables of your installed apps are created in your database file.
